# Nextcloud cookbook app documentation

This is the documentation area for the nextcloud cookbook app.
The documentation covers three different aspects of the app.

- [Documentation for usage of the app as regular user](user/)
- [Documentation for the administrator of a nextcloud instance](admin/)
- [Documentation for developers](dev/)

All the documentation can be found in the `/docs/` folder in the [app's repository]({{ site.github.url }}).
If you feel like you want to add more information or enhance the documentation, you are welcome to open a PR against the main repository.
