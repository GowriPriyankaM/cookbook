# How to get in contact

There are different ways to get in contact with the team of the cookbook app.

## GitHub

For anything related to bugs and code issues, feel free to open issues on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/nextcloud/cookbook/issues).
There are already appropriate templates present.
Just fill them out and we will try to help you at best.

Additionally, there are the [discussion pages](https://github.com/nextcloud/cookbook/discussions) on GitHub as well.
These are more suited for open discussion and FAQ-like questions.
There are also sections for general discussion and announcements.

## Matrix

As GitHub provides only relatively slow communication, we set up also some Matrix channels.
These allow live chatting in a room with other users and some of the devs.
This might be faster from time to time to get things sorted out.

We have the following rooms:

- [The main room for general questions](https://matrix.to/#/#nextcloud-cookbook:matrix.org)
- [The documentation room for comments related to the documentation](https://matrix.to/#/#nextcloud-cookbook-doc:matrix.org)
- [The API room for devs of 3rd party software](https://matrix.to/#/#nextcloud-cookbook-integration:matrix.org)

## Third party apps

The various third party apps and integrations are not part of this repository.
These apps should be supported by the appropriate maintainers.

Of course, if the problem is in the backend, you should bring the problem to us.
Then, we can try to fix it or contact the author to track down the problem.

You can try to reach out in the matrix chat as some of the devs of the third party integrations are present there as well.
