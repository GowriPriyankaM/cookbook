## Importing Recipes

### Importing from a Website

Recipes can be imported by entering the URL to a recipe in the text-input field in the top right area of the Cookbook app.

However, the Cookbook app requires the recipe site to support the [schema.org recipe standard](http://www.schema.org/Recipe)’s JSON+LD meta data. Those websites which don't provide the required data are currently not supported.


## Sharing Recipes

### Sharing with another Nextcloud User

Currently, the only way to share recipes is by sharing the Nextcloud folder that contains all recipes with another Nextcloud user. To this end, the folder first needs to be shared from the Nextcloud Files app. Afterwards it can be set as the recipe directory in the Cookbook app’s `Settings` section

### Public Sharing

At the moment it is not possible to share a public link to a recipe.
