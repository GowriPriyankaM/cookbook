# Development documentation

This documentation should contain dedicated information about the cookbook app.
No general information about the internals of nextcloud should be published here as these tend to change and thus get dated.
Instead we want to reference the official documentation on [docs.nextcloud.com](https://docs.nextcloud.com), especially the development manual.

## Github related information

- [Automatic deployment of new releases](deployment)
- [Documentation using github pages](docs)
- [Using a committed version for testing](use-autobuild)
